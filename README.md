# Road Condition Foundation Model

This repository contains the code, model architecture, and pretrained weights for the **Road Condition Foundation Model**, designed to improve road condition assessment through adaptive feature refinement. The model is trained on diverse datasets capturing road conditions from different perspective views, enabling robust generalization across varying environments.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Foundation Model for Road Condition Monitoring:** Generalizes well across different environments and road types.
- **Multi-Perspective Learning:** Trained on datasets with top-down, oblique, and frontal views for comprehensive assessment.
- **Adaptive Feature Refinement:** Enhances object detection performance for fine-grained pavement defect localization.
- **Pretrained Weights:** Available for fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets or zero-shot learning applications.
